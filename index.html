	<h3 id="Practice is how you learn"> <b><center> Exposure and practice is the key to learning </center></b> </h3>
	

	<p>Data literacy is very important these days, especially with the rapidly changing priorities in today's environment. </p>
	
		    <p>In the past, I relied on people to interpret data for me. However, I quickly realized this is a short term fix to a long term problem. </p>
		    <p>Literacy is important, <i>period</i>. Teaching a man to fish is the best way to empower people to make the best decisions throughout their life. </p>
		<p>The new generation must be able to interpret data to inform actionable decision making.</p> 
		<p>The goal of this blog is to help teach readers how to interpret data, one step at a time.</p>
	
		  
	<p> Let's start with a relevant example that most people can relate to: walkability. </p>
		
	<p>	I will use the Walkscore API to help users understand how to read and interpret walkability and transit scores in the area they reside in.</p>
	
<p>	For this blog post, I will analyze the walkability of the city I live in, Philadelphia, which is the city of brotherly love. </p>
	<p>Very excited to start this journey with all of you. Let's begin!</p>
		    
		    
		    
		    <p><i>Special thanks to platforms that prioritize making data accessible for educational purposes!</i></p>
